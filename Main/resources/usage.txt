BACPAC To D

Provides D read-only access to SQL Server BACPAC files.
This program will pre-process BACPAC files and generate D code that you can then include in your D project.

It creates a source file for every parsed BACPAC file.  This is a list of annotated structs for each table 
in the BACPAC.  It also outputs a pre-written D file which includes methods to read this data given a BACPAC 
at run time.  

This enables fast introspected full data fetches.  The trade off is that the schema of the runtime version is 
expected to match the compiled version, and changes to this schema will require recompilation of your project.  

This program does not provide any indexed access, data processing, or a query layer.  It is designed to extract 
records out of a runtime provided BACPAC file into native D types ready for use.  It cannot write changes back 
to the BACPAC.

The expected use case is to read a whole table once, then keep the returned collection for later use.  Although 
the access is designed to be fast, it does require opening the BACPAC and decompressing the data, so this should
not be repeated unnecessarily.

Usage:

BACPACToD [--input input_path_filter] [--output_directory directory_name] [--module_name destination_module_name]

  --input input_path_filter
    Where `input_path_filter` is the directory location and filter for any BACPAC files.  It is recommended that this
    ends with `.bacpac`.The default is `*.bacpac`.

  --output_directory directory_name
    Where `directory_name` is the location the D files will be written to.  This will be one file for each processed 
    BACPAC, and bacpac.d which you can use to access the data.  If only one BACPAC is found, the destination filename 
    will be 
    
  --module_name destination_module_name
    Where `destination_module_name` can be used to specify the output module name if there is only one input BACPAC
    file.  If there are multiple input BACPAC files, then module names are inferred from the source files.
    The default is "table_definitions".
    
Return codes:
    0 - Success
    1 - Help shown
    2 - No files found
    3 - Invalid or unexpected BACPAC contents or other failure
